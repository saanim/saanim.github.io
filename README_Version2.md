# Saanim — Static Portfolio Template

Drop these files into your `saanim.github.io` repository root.

What the scaffold includes:
- Responsive layout (mobile-first)
- Dark / light mode (toggle + persists)
- Portfolio grid and hero section
- Custom cursor (disabled on touch devices)
- Per-element accent highlights via `data-accent`

How to use:
1. Copy the files into your repo:
   - index.html
   - assets/css/style.css
   - assets/js/main.js
2. Commit & push to `main` (or default branch).
3. Ensure repository name is `saanim.github.io`. In GitHub → Settings → Pages: Source set to branch `main` (root).
4. Visit: https://saanim.github.io/

Customization tips:
- Change colors by updating CSS variables in `:root`.
- Add `data-accent="#HEX"` to any element to change the accent while hovered.
- Replace placeholder images with your project screenshots (place in `assets/images/`).
- If you want keyboard-accessible focus styles, add focus-visible styles in the CSS for `.btn:focus` and links.
